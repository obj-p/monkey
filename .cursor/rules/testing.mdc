# Test-driven development

## Context

- Applies to all code changes
- Encourages defining constraints to ensure code changes meets the desired requirements

## Requirements

- Only implement what was asked. Do not include code changes or unit tests for behavior that were not requested explicitly.
- All proposed code changes should first be implemented in a corresponding test file
- An accompanying unit test should ensure the behavior of the code changes
- Once the code changes are in a satisfactory state and pass the unit tests, they may 
be refactored to an implementation file and the unit test updated
